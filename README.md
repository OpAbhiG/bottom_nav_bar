# Flutter Modern Bottom Navigation Bar with FAB

This Flutter project demonstrates a modern bottom navigation bar with a floating action button (FAB) positioned at the center. The design is sleek, user-friendly, and ideal for apps with multiple navigation screens.

## Features
- Floating Action Button (FAB) at the center of the `BottomAppBar`.
- Custom icon (`assets/b-nobg.png`) for the FAB.
- Dynamic screen navigation using `IndexedStack`.
- Highlighted icons and labels for the selected tab.
- Five dummy screens: Dashboard, Doctors, Profile, Appointments, and Treatments.
